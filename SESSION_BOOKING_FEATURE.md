Users can now book safety training sessions and all bookings are saved to the MongoDB database with proper authentication.

## Backend Setup

### Files Created:
1. **models/SessionBooking.js** - MongoDB model for session bookings
2. **controllers/sessionController.js** - Handles booking logic
3. **routes/sessions.js** - API routes for session operations

### API Endpoints:

  "preferredDate": "2025-01-15",
  "sessionDetails": {
    "instructor": "John Smith",
    "duration": "2 hours",
    "price": 0,
    "slots": 20
  }
}
```
